# LPS-Shock

Modelling temperature response to LPS-shock

This repository contains R-Code, experimentally and *in silico* produced data for the purpose of fitting response curves to LPS-induced hypothermia in mice with the drc-package in R.

Author: Hans H. Diebner, Ruhr-Universität Bochum

Theoretical background of the kinetic response model as well as the application to the analysis of experimentally recorded time series are described in

This information will be updated upon changes in the publication status.

The proposed model and the R-coded algorithm has been used previously for the analysis presented in
